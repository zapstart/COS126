This assignment allows optional <i>partnering</i>. If you choose to do this,
you must follow the <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr15/cos126/assignments.php#pairing">pair programming guidelines</a>.
Please note that writing code with a partner without following the pair
programming instructions is a violation of the course collaboration policy.
All writing of code, comments, the readme, and uploading to the dropbox
should be done together
from start to finish. 
If you come to office hours alone, you can get advice, but you may not change any code until both partners are together.

<p>
Write a program to simulate plucking a guitar string using
the <em>Karplus-Strong</em> algorithm. This algorithm played a seminal
role in the emergence of physically modeled sound synthesis (where
a physical description of a musical instrument is used to synthesize
sound electronically).

</p><p><b>Digital audio.</b>
Before reading this assignment, review the material in the textbook
on digital audio (pp. 147–151, 202–206).


</p><p><b>Simulate the plucking of a guitar string.</b>
When a guitar string is plucked, the string vibrates and creates sound.
The length of the string determines its <em>fundamental frequency</em> of vibration.
We model a guitar string by sampling its <em>displacement</em> (a real
number between –1/2 and +1/2) at <em>N</em>
equally spaced points in time. The integer <em>N</em> equals
the <em>sampling rate</em> (44,100 Hz) divided by the desired fundamental
frequency, rounded <b>up</b> to the next integer.

-->


<p>
<!--
A guitar-player can shorten the vibrating portion of a string by pressing
the string against one of the frets.
The guitar vibrates at a different frequency, depending on this length.
-->


</p><ul>
<li><em>Plucking the string.</em>
The excitation of the string can contain energy at any frequency.
We simulate the excitation with <em>white noise</em>:
set each of the <em>N</em> displacements
to a random real number between –1/2 and +1/2.
<!-- This represents the "initial harmonic transients found in the attack of a real guitar." -->

</blockquote>
<p>


</p><p></p></li><li><em>The resulting vibrations.</em>
After the string is plucked, the string vibrates.
The pluck causes a displacement which spreads wave-like over time.
The Karplus-Strong algorithm simulates this vibration by maintaining
a <em>ring buffer</em> of the <em>N</em> samples: the algorithm
repeatedly deletes the first sample from the buffer 
and adds to the end of the buffer the average of the first two samples,
scaled by an <em>energy decay factor</em> of 0.996.


<p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="COS%20126%20Programming%20Assignment:%20Plucking%20a%20Guitar%20String_files/karplus-strong.png" alt="the Karplus-Strong update">
</blockquote>
<p>

</p></li></ul>

<p><b>Why it works?</b>
The two primary components that make the Karplus-Strong algorithm
work are the ring buffer feedback mechanism and the averaging operation.

</p><ul>
<li><em>The ring buffer feedback mechanism.</em>
The ring buffer models the medium (a string tied down at both ends)
in which the energy travels back and forth.
The length of the ring buffer determines the fundamental frequency
of the resulting sound.  Sonically, the feedback  
mechanism reinforces only the fundamental frequency and its  
harmonics (frequencies at integer multiples of the fundamental).  The  
energy decay factor (.996 in this case)
models the slight dissipation in energy as the wave makes a  
round trip through the string.

<p></p></li><li><em>The averaging operation.</em>
The averaging operation serves as a gentle <em>low-pass filter</em>
(which removes higher frequencies while allowing lower frequencies to pass,
hence the name).  Because it is in the path of the  
feedback, this has the effect of gradually attenuating the higher  
harmonics while keeping the lower ones, which corresponds closely with  
how a plucked guitar string sounds. 

</li></ul>

From a mathematical physics viewpoint, the Karplus-Strong algorithm approximately solves
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation">1D wave equation</a>,
which describes the transverse motion of the string as a function of time.

<!--
At a high level, the Karplus-Strong algorithm approximately solves
the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation">1D wave equation</a>,
which describes the motion of the string as a function of time.
The wave shape spreads out over time.
The vibration gradually eliminates those frequencies introduced by the
pluck that don't match the string's fundamental frequency of the string,
with the higher frequencies decaying faster than the lower ones.
Eventually, the wave shape will be sinusoidal with frequency equal
to the string's fundamental frequency.
The Karplus-Strong averaging formula is an extremely simplified
method that results in a similar effect, though it remains a bit
of a mystery even to experts.
-->
<!-- The energy decay factor models the friction at the string end points. -->


<p><b>Ring buffer.</b>
Your first task is to create a data type to model the ring buffer.
Write a class named <tt>RingBuffer</tt> that implements the following API:

</p><blockquote><pre>public class RingBuffer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        RingBuffer(int capacity)  // create an empty ring buffer, with given max capacity
    int size()                    // return number of items currently in the buffer
boolean isEmpty()                 // is the buffer empty (size equals zero)?
boolean isFull()                  // is the buffer full  (size equals capacity)?
   void enqueue(double x)         // add item x to the end
 double dequeue()                 // delete and return item from the front
 double peek()                    // return (but do not delete) item from the front
 static void main(String[] args)  // test client, tests all methods
</pre></blockquote>


Since the ring buffer has a known maximum capacity,
implement it using a <tt>double</tt> array of that length.
For efficiency, use <em>cyclic wrap-around</em>: this
ensures that each operation can be done in a constant amount of time.
We recommend you maintain
one integer instance variable <tt>first</tt> that stores the index
of the least recently inserted item; maintain a second integer instance
variable <tt>last</tt> that stores the index one beyond the most recently
inserted item.
To insert an item, put it at index <tt>last</tt> and increment <tt>last</tt>.
To remove an item, take it from index <tt>first</tt> and increment <tt>first</tt>.
When either index equals <tt>capacity</tt>, make it wrap-around by changing
the index to <tt>0</tt>.

<p>Implement <tt>RingBuffer</tt> to throw a run-time exception if the client attempts to <tt>enqueue()</tt> into a full buffer or call 
<tt>dequeue()</tt> or <tt>peek()</tt> on an empty buffer.

</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="COS%20126%20Programming%20Assignment:%20Plucking%20a%20Guitar%20String_files/ring-buffer.png" alt="Ring buffer">
</blockquote>

<p>Your test client may contain the tests we give you, 
ones you write yourself, or a combination thereof.

</p><p><b>Guitar string.</b>
Next, create a data type to model a vibrating guitar string.
Write a class named <tt>GuitarString</tt> that implements the following API:
  
</p><blockquote><pre>public class GuitarString
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       GuitarString(double frequency)  // create a guitar string of the given frequency, using a sampling rate of 44,100
       GuitarString(double[] init)     // create a guitar string whose size and initial values are given by the array
  void pluck()                         // pluck the guitar string by replacing the buffer with white noise
  void tic()                           // advance the simulation one time step
double sample()                        // return the current sample
   int time()                          // return number of times tic was called so far
static void main(String[] args)        // test client, tests all methods
</pre></blockquote>


<ul>

<p></p><li><em>Constructors.</em>
There are two ways to create a <tt>GuitarString</tt> object.

<ul>

<p></p><li>
The first constructor creates a <tt>RingBuffer</tt> of the
desired capacity <em>N</em>
(<the em="">sampling rate 44,100 divided by <em>frequency</em>, rounded <b>up</b> to the nearest integer),
and initializes it to represent a guitar string at rest by enqueueing
<em>N</em> zeros.

<p></p></the></li><li>
The second constructor creates a <tt>RingBuffer</tt> of capacity equal
to the size of the array, and initializes the 
contents of the buffer to the values in the array.
On this assignment, its main purpose is for debugging and grading.

</li></ul>

<p></p></li><li><em>Pluck.</em> Replace the <em>N</em> items in the ring buffer with 
<em>N</em> random values between -0.5 and +0.5.

<p></p></li><li><em>Tic.</em> Apply the Karplus-Strong update: delete the sample at the 
front of the ring buffer and add to the end of the ring buffer the average of the first 
two samples, multiplied by the energy decay factor.

<p></p></li><li><em>Sample.</em> Return the value of the item at the front of the ring buffer.


<p></p></li><li><em>Time.</em> Return the total number of times <tt>tic()</tt> was called on this instance.


</li></ul>


<p>Again, your test client may contain the tests we give you, 
ones you write yourself, or a combination thereof.


</p><p><b>Interactive guitar player.</b>
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/guitar/GuitarHeroLite.java">GuitarHeroLite.java</a>
is a sample <tt>GuitarString</tt> client
that plays the guitar in real-time, using the
keyboard to input notes. When the user types the lowercase
letter <tt>'a'</tt> or <tt>'c'</tt>, the program plucks the
corresponding string. Since the combined result of several sound waves
is the superposition of the individual sound waves, we play the 
sum of all string samples.

</p><blockquote>
<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD" border="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr><td><pre>
  public class GuitarHeroLite {
      public static void main(String[] args) {

          // create two guitar strings, for concert A and C

          double CONCERT_C = CONCERT_A * Math.pow(2, 3.0/12.0); 
          GuitarString stringA = new GuitarString(CONCERT_A);
          GuitarString stringC = new GuitarString(CONCERT_C);

          while (true) {

              // check if the user has typed a key; if so, process it   
              if (StdDraw.hasNextKeyTyped()) {
                  char key = StdDraw.nextKeyTyped();
                  if      (key == 'a') { stringA.pluck(); }
                  else if (key == 'c') { stringC.pluck(); }
              }

              // compute the superposition of samples
              double sample = stringA.sample() + stringC.sample();
  
              // play the sample on standard audio
              StdAudio.play(sample);
  
              // advance the simulation of each guitar string by one step   
              stringA.tic();
              stringC.tic();
          }
       }
  }

Write a program <tt>GuitarHero</tt> that is similar to <tt>GuitarHeroLite</tt>,
but supports a total of 37 notes on the chromatic scale from
110Hz to 880Hz. Use the following 37 keys to represent the keyboard,
from lowest note to highest note:

<!--ake the <em>i</em>th character of the string-->

<blockquote><pre>String keyboard = "q2we4r5ty7u8i9op-[=zxdcfvgbnjmk,.;/' ";
</pre></blockquote>

This keyboard arrangement imitates a piano keyboard:
The "white keys" are on the <tt>qwerty</tt> and <tt>zxcv</tt>
rows and the "black keys" on the <tt>12345</tt> and <tt>asdf</tt> rows of the
keyboard.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>


<!--The <em>i</em>th character of the string
corresponds to a frequency of 440 &times; 1.05956<sup>(<em>i</em> - 24)</sup>,
so that the character <tt>'q'</tt> is approximately 110Hz,  <tt>'i'</tt> is close to 220Hz,
<tt>'v'</tt> is close to 440Hz, and  <tt>' '</tt> is close to 880Hz.
(The reason these numbers are not exact has to do with the fact that we are using finite
frequency precision, instead of the theoretical and perfect infinite frequency precision.
We make some adjustments so that our abbreviated computation still results 
in a nice on-pitch sound.)-->

The <em>i</em>th character of the string <tt>keyboard</tt>
corresponds to a frequency of 440 × 2<sup>(<em>i</em> - 24) / 
12</sup>,
so that the character <tt>'q'</tt> is 110Hz,  <tt>'i'</tt> is 220Hz,
<tt>'v'</tt> is 440Hz, and  <tt>' '</tt> is 880Hz.

Don't even think of including 37 individual <tt>GuitarString</tt> variables
or a 37-way <tt>if</tt> statement!
Instead, create an array of 37 <tt>GuitarString</tt> objects
and use <tt>keyboard.indexOf(key)</tt> to figure out which key was typed.
Make sure your program does not crash if a key is pressed that does not 
correspond to one
of your 37 notes.

In the <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr15/cos126/checklist/guitar.html#pps">Possible Progress Steps</a> on the checklist we provide optional templates for <tt>RingBuffer</tt> and <tt>GuitarString</tt>.
Here is a copy of
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/guitar/GuitarHeroLite.java">
<tt>GuitarHeroLite.java</tt></a> which you will extend to create <tt>GuitarHero</tt>.
Finally, 
we provide a 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/guitar/readme.txt">
<tt>readme.txt</tt></a>
 as well as an abbreviated
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs126/guitar/partner/readme.txt">
partner 
<tt>readme.txt</tt></a>
file — in each pair, 
one partner should submit the <tt>.java</tt> files and the long 
readme, and the other should submit only a short readme.

</p><p>
<b>Submission. </b> &nbsp;
Submit <tt>RingBuffer.java</tt>, <tt>GuitarString.java</tt>, <tt>GuitarHero.java</tt>, and a completed <tt>readme.txt</tt>. (Or, if your partner is
submitting the java files, just submit the completed partner <tt>readme.txt</tt>.)
The names, logins, and precept numbers of both partners MUST appear
at the top of every submitted file. 

</p><p><i>If you and your partner both do the extra credit separately,</i> you are both allowed to upload 
<tt>.java</tt> files to facilitate testing.



<!------ 
Too many people have StdAudio problems for this one to be fair:
<p><b>Extra credit 1.</b>
Write a program <tt>GuitarHeroVisualizer.java</tt>
(by modifying <tt>GuitarHero.java</tt>)
that plots the sound wave in real-time, as the user is playing the
keyboard guitar. The output should look something like this:

<a name='visvideo'></a>
<div style='margin:0px auto'>
<div style='width:620px; margin:0px auto'>
<iframe width="616" height="264" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/W8sp0OkV_o4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
</div>

To get credit, your program must 
(1) draw something for every sample, 
(2) run smoothly in real-time with no effects on the audio, and 
(3) run at a minimum of 24 frames per second.
Depending on your computer, you might be able to do 60 FPS or more, 
but this is not required.
Part of what is necessary to accomplish this is
the usage of animation mode as described in the 
<a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html"
>StdDraw documentation</a>, since deferring the on-screen display until
an entire frame is complete helps make the StdDraw calls fast enough to
not distort
the audio. You can add extra embellishments if you like so long
as your program satisfies 
all three aformentioned requirements.
--->

</p><p><b>Extra credit.</b> The extra credit is optional.
If working with a partner, you
can do it together or alone — but decide <i>before</i> you start it.

Write a program <tt>AutoGuitar.java</tt> that will <i>automatically</i> play a song with 
<tt>GuitarString</tt>s.
<i>The song should be between 10
seconds and 2 minutes in length.</i> It will be run with
</p><pre>% java-introcs AutoGuitar</pre>

It will make calls to <tt>StdAudio.play()</tt> but it <b>must not</b> make any
other calls to the Std* libraries. In particular, make sure there are
no calls to StdDraw, and that it works with no user input.
Your <tt>main()</tt> must terminate; it cannot loop infinitely.

To get the timing to work, either use the <tt>Stopwatch</tt> class, or use the fact that 1/44100 of a second elapses between calls to <tt>StdAudio.play()</tt>. This will make it have
consistent timing on different machines.

<p>Use arrays, loops, conditionals, and randomization as you see fit. 
If you are interested, you can add chords, repetition, or
different instruments (see below). You may submit additional classes,
but don't modify your original classes (such as <tt>GuitarString</tt>).

</p><p>If you find it helpful, you may submit a <tt>.txt</tt> file to be read with the <tt><a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/In.html">In</a></tt> class, and you may hard-code the filename in your program.

</p><p><b>Challenge for the bored.</b>
Here are suggestions on other effects and instruments to synthesize. Some come from the
<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/3680062">paper</a> of Karplus and Strong.
</p><ul>
<li> Harp strings: Flipping the sign of the new value before enqueueing it
in <tt>tic()</tt> will change the sound from guitar-like to harp-like. You may
want to play with the decay factors to improve the realism,
and adjust the buffer sizes by a factor of two since the natural resonance
frequency is cut in half by the <tt>tic()</tt> change.
</li><li> Drums: Flipping the sign of a new value with probability 0.5 before
enqueueing it in <tt>tic()</tt> will produce a drum sound. 
A decay factor of 1.0 (no decay) will yield a better sound, and 
you will need to adjust the set of frequencies used.
</li><li> Guitars
play each note on one of 6 physical strings.
To simulate this 
you can divide your <tt>GuitarString</tt> instances 
into 6 groups, and when a string is plucked, zero out
all other strings in that group.
</li><li> Pianos come with a damper pedal which can be used to make
the strings stationary. You can implement this by, on iterations where a 
certain key (such as Shift) is <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html#isKeyPressed%28int%29">held down</a>, changing the decay factor.
</li><li> While we have used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament">equal temperament,</a>
the ear finds it more pleasing when musical intervals follow the small
fractions in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation">just intonation</a>
system.
For example, when a musician uses a brass instrument to
play a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth">
perfect fifth</a> harmonically,
the ratio of frequencies is 3/2 = 1.5 rather than 2<sup>7/12</sup> ∼ 1.498. Write a program where each successive pair of notes has just intonation.
</li></ul>

<!--
Modify the Karplus-Strong algorithm to synthesize a different instrument.
Consider changing the excitation of the string (from white-noise to something 
more structured)
or changing the averaging formula (from the average of the first two samples
to a more complicated rule) or anything else you might imagine.

Submit your new instrument class with a name other than 
<tt>GuitarString.java</tt>.
Submit a client program that calls this instrument class and has a name other than 
<tt>GuitarHero.java</tt>.  We will run them with our <tt>RingBuffer.java</tt>.
